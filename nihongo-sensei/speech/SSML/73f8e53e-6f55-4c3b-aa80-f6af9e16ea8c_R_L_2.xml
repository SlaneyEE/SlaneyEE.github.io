        <s>The Japanese language is comprised of not one, not two, but three distinct writing systems:</s>
        <s>Hiragana: Composed of characters that represent a unique sound or syllable and it is used for native Japanese words.Katakana: Composed of characters that represent a unique sound or syllable and it is used for foreign words.Kanji: Composed of characters borrowed from Chinese and it is used to represent whole words.</s>
        <s>These three writing systems play a crucial role in the Japanese language, and together, they form the backbone of written Japanese.</s>
